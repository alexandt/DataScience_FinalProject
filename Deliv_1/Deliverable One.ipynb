    "For our research project, we wanted to toy with data related to music. After some consideration, we decided to attempt a prediciton of next months top 200 songs on spotify from a list of upcoming albums. As it stands, we are going to synthesise a few different metrics for our final prediction. We plan to analyze the artists previous history of top 200 songs and create a function that weights the artists likely hood of being in the top 200 songs by the longevity of previous songs on the chart. We also plan to look at twitter for chatter about the upcoming album. This data will be saved for the next iteration of the project."

    "The data on upcoming albums was scraped from a website called \"consequenceofsound\". The code for the scraping is included in another notebook titled \"New Release Data\". The notebook clearly outlines the process. The gist of the process was to use BeautifulSoup to scrape the site for albums within about a two month range. We chose May and June as the months were going to make predictions for inorder to check the results of the predictions not too far down the road. On top of this, we believe that these sorts of preidcitons are quite volatile and attempting to make predictions far in the future would be futile.\n",

    "The data for the top 200 charts was scraped from the website \"spotifycharts.com\". The code for the scraping is inlcuded in another notebook titled \"Make Top 200 Table\". Scraping this data was a little more involved than the prevoius scrape job. The process begins by using BeautifulSoup to retrieve the dates for all the available charts. Next, a bash script was used to update the website url to download a chart per date. The wget function was used for this. Finally, using pandas the data was synthesized into one large chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing, for these datasets, was completed in the notebooks mentioned above. Some of the cleaning that needed to be done inlcuded removing artifacts caused by switching the coding system from Latin1 to UTF-8. There were issues with whitespace before and after entries. The spotify charts website inlcuded more metadata than we needed, which needed to be removed. It's worth checking out the other notebooks for more details regarding the preprocessing process."
